## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Addressing class imbalance using **SMOTE/undersampling**
   - Feature engineering & standardization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizing transaction distributions
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Fraud vs. non-fraud comparison

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split
   - Training baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
   - Building a **deep learning model** (e.g., fully connected NN or BERT)
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, F1-score
   - Classification report and performance plots
