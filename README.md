# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis Using BERT

This project uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to perform sentiment analysis on hotel reviews. It walks through data preprocessing, BERT tokenization, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and visualization using PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers.

---

## üîç Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify hotel reviews as positive or negative based on customer feedback.
- **Dataset:** Hotel review dataset (custom or publicly available).
- **Model:** Pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` fine-tuned for binary sentiment classification.
- **Tools Used:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
